## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow



### What I learned

I think shadows was the part more dificult in this project, making multiple shadows was a little confusing at first, it is not perfect but I think the result was good.
The overlay background was something new that I learned to do in this challenge but it was something fun to do.


### Continued development

I want to focus how properly use unit like px, em, rem, etc., and try to learn more about responsive.
